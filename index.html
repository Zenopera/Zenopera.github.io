            <p>
                <strong>Hey! I'm Zeno.</strong><br>
                I am an MSc student in <strong>Mathematical Engineering</strong> 
                (Statistical Learning track) at <strong>Politecnico di Milano</strong>,
                currently working as a <strong>Data Science Intern</strong> at the
                <strong>Ministry of Education of Luxembourg</strong>
                (SCRIPT Service, Data Division).
            </p>

            <p>
                I will graduate in <strong>March 2026</strong> and I am currently looking for a
                role that motivates me and allows me to apply my technical skills while
                continuously learning and growing.
            </p>

            <p>
                I consider myself a sociable and proactive person who enjoys working in
                stimulating and challenging environments, where collaboration and the
                exchange of knowledge play a key role in achieving meaningful results.
