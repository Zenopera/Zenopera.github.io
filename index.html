            <p><em>Politecnico di Milano | 2020 – 2023</em></p>
    
            <p>
                During my Bachelor's degree, I studied the <strong>Mathematical Engineering program</strong> 
                at Politecnico di Milano. The curriculum covered a wide range of mathematical and engineering topics 
                and introduced the practical applications of mathematics in areas such as finance, modeling, 
                and data science, which I found very engaging.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Developed strong engineering knowledge with a solid mathematical foundation. 
                Focused on advanced mathematical, numerical, and statistical methodologies 
                for modeling and solving complex problems, and acquired expertise in optimization 
                techniques, data analysis, and computational methods.

            <p>
                I continued my education with a Master's degree in <strong>Mathematical Engineering</strong>, 
                choosing the <strong>Statistical Learning track</strong> to deepen my expertise in data-driven modeling.

                Characterizing courses included <strong>Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning, 
                Applied Statistics, Bayesian Statistics, Real and Functional Analysis</strong>. 
                The program focuses on advanced methodologies for statistical modeling and 
                problem solving using data.

            <h3>Master Thesis – Trivariate Non-Parametric Model</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a trivariate, data-driven model to analyze the effects of classroom environments 
                on student performance. Each class was associated with a cluster representing positive 
                or negative impact on student scores, estimated using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. 
                The methodology was inspired by research at Politecnico di Milano and applied in the context 
                of Luxembourgish educational data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The model has been successfully used at SCRIPT, Ministry of Education of Luxembourg.

            <h3>Deep Learning – Blood Cell Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Collaborated on a multi-class image classification project to identify 8 types of blood cells 
                from 96x96 RGB images. Started with a baseline CNN and progressed to transfer learning with 
                pre-trained models, applying fine-tuning, data augmentation, and regularization to improve performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final model (ConvNeXtSmall) reached 97.66% accuracy on local test data, providing practical experience 
                in deep learning, model fine-tuning, and collaborative development.

                <strong>My contribution:</strong> Selected layers for fine-tuning, refined augmentation strategies, 
                and optimized the model pipeline.

            <h3>Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)</h3>
            <p>
                Applied Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling to analyze the impact of advertising, pricing, and 
                competitor activities on sales in the fiber-optic telecommunications industry. 
                The goal was to provide a probabilistic approach for optimizing marketing budget allocation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developed and compared three Bayesian models: 
                one using Fourier basis functions to capture seasonality, 
                one using Gaussian Processes for time-varying advertising effects, 
                and one combining both approaches. Each model accounted for non-linear effects and diminishing returns.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project provided hands-on experience in Bayesian statistics, time-series modeling, 
                and probabilistic decision-making.
